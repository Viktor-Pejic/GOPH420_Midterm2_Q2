a.) The shape of the data seems to be following an
exponential trend. Since the data follows a linear trend it is
possible to linearize it and transform it into a linear trending set of data.
Without a visible data trend, we would assume that linear regression is not
possible. After conducting a least squares regression, the computed R^2
value must be analyzed to assess a goodness of fit of the data to the trend.
If the R^2 value is close to 1, then we can confidently say that the model accurately
depicts the data trend.

b.) The linearization will need to be done by taking the natural log of both sides of the
given equation and plotting the data in ln space. The linearized version of the function is
ln(V_p) = ln(V_0) + k * p. Therefore our computed parameter V_0 = ln(a0) and k = a1 where
a0 and a1 are the model parameters.

d.) R^2 = 0.8996

Our R^2 value depicts a very good fit as it is relatively close to 1. Yes our assumptions
in a.) are shown in our regression line plot over the raw data as we can clearly see the
trend of the data following the linear regression line.
